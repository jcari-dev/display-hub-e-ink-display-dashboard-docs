# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Data

**Is any of this data being collected and sent anywhere?**  
It is not collected by me and all form inputs are stored locally (like, in your Raspberry Pi). However, this does not mean that the services providing the APIs do not collect information about what is being queried or requested.

## Hardware


### Displays
**Can I just use any e-ink display that I have around?**  
The project leverages existing classes and methods from Waveshare, particularly the `draw on screen` function, to create the output as intended. While technically you can use any Waveshare-compatible e-ink display, the results may not align perfectly with the intended design.
