# Hardware Requirements

To use the `Display Hub`, ensure you have the following hardware:

### 1. Raspberry Pi
- Refer to the list of supported models [here](https://example.com/).
- The main requirement is the GPIO pins. While some tuning may allow Display Hub to work on Jetson Nano or Arduino, these devices are not currently supported.

---

### 2. E-Ink Display
- Refer to the list of supported display models [here](https://example.com/).

---

### 3. Secondary Device (Optional)
- A device with a desktop environment is required to access the web GUI. _While this should still work on Raspberry Pi's with a desktop environment, it has not been tested._
