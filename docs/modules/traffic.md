### Overview

The Traffic Incidents module it is by far the most complex module. It provides real-time traffic updates for a specified location using the [TomTom Traffic API](https://www.tomtom.com/products/traffic-apis/). The module's display is a **1x3 rectangle**.

**Note:** Only US ZIP codes are supported as of now.

### Workflow

The Traffic Incidents module retrieves real-time traffic data based on user settings stored in the database.

1. **Retrieve Settings**:  
   The module pulls the userâ€™s API key and selected ZIP code from the database (`TrafficSettings` table).  

2. **ZIP Code Conversion**:  
   The ZIP code is converted into latitude and longitude coordinates using a local dataset (`US.txt`).  

3. **Define Bounding Box**:  
   A small bounding box around the derived coordinates is calculated to narrow the area for traffic incident queries.  

4. **API Request**:  
   The TomTom API is queried with the bounding box, filtering incidents based on specific categories such as accidents, road closures, or heavy traffic.  

5. **Response Handling**:  
   The API's response is processed to extract incident details, including category and coordinates.  

6. **Reverse Geocoding**:  
   Incident coordinates are reverse-geocoded to obtain human-readable addresses.  

7. **Address Formatting**:  
   Addresses are abbreviated for better readability, and incidents are compiled into a list for display.
     - As of now only one which is randomly selected is used for the screen.
