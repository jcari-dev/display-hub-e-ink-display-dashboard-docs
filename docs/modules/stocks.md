Here is the list of currently supported Raspberry Pi devices:

| **Model**                                                 | **Support Status**                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/)        | ✅ Fully Functional                                                       |
| [Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) | ⚠️ Functional (installation can be lengthy- takes 5–8 minutes)          |

The Display Hub should technically work with other Raspberry Pi models, provided a compatible display is attached, but it has not been tested on devices beyond those listed above.
